            <p>
              I’m Tres, the founder of ProductHQ. I’m an experienced Senior
              Product Manager having launched dozens of successful products in
              my corporate job as a Senior Product Manager. While doing this,
              I’ve found collecting, analysing and organising customer feedback
              to be a nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve looked at other products but was not really happy with what I
              saw. Outdated, super expensive, huge learning curves, and more.
              Being a Product Manager, and like most SaaS founders, I thought
              I’d scratch my own itch and build a product that addressed all
              these issues.
            </p>
            <p>
              ProductHQ has three core features: the ideas board to collect
              feedback and upvotes, the roadmap to prioritise and communicate
              your progress, and what’s new to announce your awesome features to
              the world. This is only the beginning. I have a LOT more
              awesomeness planned.
            </p>
            <p>
              ProductHQ is built for Product people, SaaS founders,
              entrepreneurs, and those who value feedback from their customers.
              It’s focused on beautiful, simple, and easy to use design, while
              delivering value to its customers.
