To streamline the process of starting a new feature with all the necessary documentation, you can structure the /features/feature-name folder so that when you copy it, it contains all the core files needed for feature development. Here's how you can organize it for maximum efficiency:

Suggested Folder Structure for Features

/features
│── /feature-name
│   ├── feature-prd.md            # Product Requirements Document (Template)
│   ├── feature-architecture.md   # Technical architecture, including backend, DB, APIs, etc.
│   ├── feature-ui.md             # UI/UX design, component breakdown
│   ├── feature-database.md       # Database schema changes for the feature (if needed)
│   ├── feature-api.md            # API endpoints for the feature
│   ├── feature-state.md          # State management specifics (if applicable)
│   ├── feature-testing.md        # Testing strategy, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
│   ├── feature-release.md        # Release notes and deployment instructions
│   ├── feature-feedback.md       # Any feedback specifically related to the feature
│   └── feature-timeline.md       # Timeline and milestones for feature development

How It Works:

Start with a Template Folder:
Create a template folder (/features/feature-template) that contains all the necessary documents. When starting a new feature, you simply copy this folder, rename it, and begin filling in the details.

Documents to Include in the Template Folder:

feature-prd.md: Contains a detailed Product Requirements Document that outlines the feature’s goals, user stories, and acceptance criteria.

feature-architecture.md: A section for describing how the feature fits into the overall app architecture, including backend structure, API changes, and data flow.

feature-ui.md: UI/UX design, detailing any new components, layout changes, or updates to the design system.

feature-database.md: If the feature requires database changes, describe the changes to tables, relationships, and schema here.
feature-api.md: Document any new API endpoints, data models, or services required for the feature.

feature-state.md: If the feature requires state management on the client side, document how this will be handled (e.g., Redux, Context API, etc.).

feature-testing.md: This section details the testing plan for the feature, including test cases for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

feature-release.md: Instructions on how to deploy, any migrations, and release notes.

feature-feedback.md: A place to track any feedback from users, testers, or stakeholders related to the feature.

feature-timeline.md: A timeline that maps out milestones, sprint planning, and deadlines for the feature development.

Benefits of This Setup:
Speed: When starting a new feature, you only need to copy the template folder, saving time by not having to create each file from scratch.

Consistency: Each feature will have the same set of documentation, making it easier to track progress and ensure that all aspects of the feature are covered.

Clarity: The structure ensures that everyone involved in the feature (product, design, dev, QA) knows where to find the necessary information.

Future Considerations:
You could integrate this structure with tools like Confluence (for online collaboration) or Git if you're managing documentation in version-controlled repositories, so your docs stay versioned alongside the feature code.
