Purpose of the PRD
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is designed to clearly define the scope, requirements, and goals of a new feature. It serves as a roadmap for the development process, aligning the product team (designers, developers, product managers) on the feature’s objectives and success criteria. The PRD ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of the feature's purpose, how it will function, and the timeline for delivery.

How to Use This PRD
Fill in the Feature Information:
Complete the top section with basic details (Feature Name, Owner, Date, Version). This gives everyone a quick reference point for the feature.

Define the User Stories:
Break down the feature into actionable user stories and acceptance criteria. This ensures clear, measurable goals and helps prioritize what’s most important.

List Feature Requirements:
Specify functional and non-functional requirements in detail. This guides the development team on what needs to be built and the expectations around performance and scalability.

Provide Design References:
Link to any UI mockups, wireframes, or visual guides to ensure consistent design implementation.

Outline the Technical Specifications:
Include details on backend and frontend requirements, such as API endpoints, database changes, state management, and UI libraries.

Set Milestones and Timeline:
Break the feature into key milestones with deadlines, ensuring clear ownership and accountability throughout development.

Define Testing and QA Criteria:
List the types of testing needed (unit, integration, E2E), and identify edge cases or scenarios that should be tested.

Track Metrics & Post-Launch:
Define how success will be measured using key metrics and KPIs. Plan post-launch monitoring and feedback collection to ensure continuous improvement.

Identify Risks & Mitigation Plans:
Highlight potential risks and outline strategies to mitigate them, ensuring proactive risk management.
