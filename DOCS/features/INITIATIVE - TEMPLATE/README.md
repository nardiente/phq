1. feature-api.md
Purpose: Contains details on the API endpoints required for this feature, including the request/response format, authentication, and any associated backend logic.
How to Use: Developers should refer to this document to implement the backend functionality and integrate the feature with the API. Ensure you follow the defined endpoints, request parameters, and error handling guidelines.

2. feature-spec.md
Purpose: Describes the technical and functional specifications of the feature, including user requirements, edge cases, and any technical constraints.
How to Use: This document should be referred to by developers and product managers to understand the full scope of the feature. It will ensure alignment between the feature’s intended functionality and the actual implementation.
3. feature-state.md

Purpose: Details how state will be managed within the feature, including the use of local state, global state (e.g., Redux, Context API), and any data flow considerations.
How to Use: Use this document as a guide when implementing client-side logic to ensure consistent and predictable state management across the feature.

4. feature-ui.md
Purpose: Provides a breakdown of the UI components and layout specific to the feature, including visual design elements, component usage, and interactions.
How to Use: Designers and frontend developers should refer to this document to implement the UI. It contains detailed instructions for building out the UI in accordance with the design system and ensuring consistency with the rest of the application.

Usage Instructions
Start with the feature-spec.md:
Begin by reviewing the technical and functional specifications to fully understand the feature’s requirements and the expected behavior.

API Development:
Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, move on to feature-api.md to implement the necessary API endpoints, paying close attention to the request/response formats and authentication mechanisms.

State Management:
Refer to feature-state.md to ensure that your state management strategy is consistent with the rest of the application. This will help avoid any issues related to data flow or performance.

UI Implementation:
After the backend and state management are in place, turn to feature-ui.md for a detailed breakdown of the UI components and layout. Follow the design guidelines to implement the frontend components.

Testing:
As you implement the feature, make sure to refer back to the documents to verify the feature against the requirements. Ensure you follow the testing strategies laid out in feature-spec.md to validate the feature thoroughly.

Additional Notes

Collaboration:
Keep the lines of communication open with other team members (designers, backend developers, QA) to ensure the feature is being implemented correctly and to resolve any ambiguities early on.

Version Control:
Always check the version of the document you are working with and make sure to keep the files up to date with any changes made during the development process.

Feedback:
If any new requirements or changes arise during development, update the documentation accordingly and ensure that all team members are informed of the changes.
