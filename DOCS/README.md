Introduction to the Feature Building Plan with Cursor AI
Building successful features in a fast-paced development environment requires a structured and repeatable approach. This plan, designed for use with Cursor AI (along with Claude and Gemini 2.0), provides a step-by-step framework that helps developers and product teams create high-quality features more efficiently. By leveraging Cursor's powerful AI and tools like its composer function, .cursorrules, and cursor.directory, this method ensures you maintain consistency across code, documentation, and design while saving valuable time in the development process.

This guide is structured to support developers and product managers in planning, building, and refining features from start to finish. Each step is geared toward reducing rework, improving accuracy, and fostering collaboration between the team and Cursor AI to create scalable, high-quality software.

Target Audience
This process is ideal for:

Product Managers: Who need to ensure alignment between design, functionality, and business goals while managing feature timelines.

Frontend/Backend Developers: Who need clear specifications, reusable templates, and structured coding practices to work efficiently.

UI/UX Designers: Who want to ensure that the design system is maintained, and the user experience is consistent across all features.

Why This Process Works
Cursor AI's unique tools integrate smoothly with existing development workflows. By following these steps, you can:

Save Time: Cursor’s prompt management and AI features accelerate development by automating repetitive tasks and offering reusable templates.

Stay Organized: Every decision, from design to implementation, is documented in structured files (.md, .json) that are easy to update and maintain.

Maintain Consistency: By having a clear and centralized process, your team will ensure consistent coding practices, UI patterns, and even design elements, which improves the overall quality of the product.

Streamline Communication: The process of saving working code, asking for explanations, and syncing docs helps reduce communication gaps between team members, designers, and AI tools.
Important Terms to Know

PRD (Product Requirements Document): A critical file that outlines the feature's goals, user stories, and success criteria.
Feature Specification Documents: Each feature will have its own folder with documents detailing the API design, state management, and UI design specifics.

.cursorrules: A file that holds customized AI guidance rules that help Cursor AI better align with your project’s specific needs.
cursor.directory: A curated collection of tech-specific prompts that can be used to improve Cursor AI's response relevance to your project stack.

Feature Folders: Each feature under development will have its own folder that houses all related code, documentation, and design elements.

Key Concepts
Structured Development: You’ll start by planning the feature (PRD), then generate reusable code templates, and eventually refine the UI and functionality.

Tech-Specific Prompts: Use cursor.directory to access tailored prompts that align with your stack (e.g., Next.js, Supabase) to ensure Cursor understands the context.
Documentation Consistency: Keeping everything in Markdown (.md) and JSON formats allows for easy reference and sharing between teams.

AI-Powered Efficiency: Whether you need design feedback, explanations of your code, or fast edits, Cursor AI helps optimize the development process at every stage.

Expected Outcome
By following this plan, you can expect:

Faster Iteration: A streamlined process to build, refine, and deploy features quickly, with clear, up-to-date documentation at each stage.

Quality Code: Reusable, clean code that follows the best practices outlined in the templates and feature specifications.
Aligned Teams: Clear documentation and a structured development approach help avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication across cross-functional teams (developers, product managers, designers).

Getting Started
To begin using this framework:

Set up your project structure using the provided scripts, which will create the necessary folders and files.
Follow the steps outlined for each feature, customizing your .cursorrules and cursor.directory files to fit the unique needs of your project.

Leverage Cursor AI to generate code snippets, refine UI elements, and document your progress in real-time.
Ensure everything is documented in the structured files, keeping your codebase organized and reusable for future features.
