Overview
The /saved-code folder contains reusable code snippets and logic that can be leveraged across various features and components of the project. These snippets are designed to streamline development by providing ready-made, tested pieces of code for common tasks such as authentication, database queries, and UI components.

This section helps improve development speed and consistency by providing a central repository for code that can be reused without having to write it from scratch each time.

Files Overview

1. auth-snippets.md
Purpose: Contains reusable code for authentication-related functionality, such as login, registration, password reset, and token management. It helps maintain consistency in how authentication processes are handled across the application.
How to Use: Use this file when implementing authentication-related features. Copy the relevant code snippets to handle user authentication securely. Modify them if needed to fit the specifics of your project, such as authentication flow or third-party integrations.

2. database-queries.md
Purpose: Provides common database queries and reusable logic for interacting with SQL or NoSQL databases. This can include queries for CRUD operations, joins, aggregation, or filtering.
How to Use: Reference this file whenever you need to interact with the database. Instead of writing common queries from scratch, use the predefined ones here. Update or extend the queries based on your project’s requirements.
3. UI-components.md

Purpose: Includes reusable UI component code, such as buttons, modals, forms, tables, and other common UI elements. These components follow the design guidelines and ensure consistency across the application.

How to Use: Use this file when creating UI components that are used across multiple pages or features. Copy the relevant code for the components you need, and ensure they align with the design system’s requirements. Modify the components to meet the specific needs of the feature you are developing.
How to Use the Saved Code

Integration with Feature Development:
Whenever you encounter a repetitive task, such as implementing a login form or writing a database query, check the relevant file in the /saved-code folder to see if there is already a reusable code snippet available.

Customization:
While the snippets are designed to be generic and reusable, they should be customized to fit your specific use case. For example, you may need to change parameters or add additional logic depending on the feature or business requirements.

Consistency:
The purpose of the /saved-code folder is to ensure consistency across the project. Whenever possible, reuse these snippets instead of reinventing the wheel. This will help make the codebase more maintainable and uniform.

Additional Notes
Code Quality:
Ensure that the code snippets remain high-quality and well-documented. If any changes are made, be sure to test them before reusing them in a live environment.

Version Control:
Keep the snippets updated as the project evolves. If a new version of a snippet is needed, create a new version in the relevant file and mark the changes clearly.

Extending the Saved Code:
As new features and requirements arise, feel free to add new snippets to this folder. Ensure that any new snippets follow the same standards for consistency and documentation.
