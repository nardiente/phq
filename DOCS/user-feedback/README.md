Overview
The /user-feedback folder contains various documents related to collecting and analyzing feedback from users. This section is essential for tracking user insights, pain points, feature requests, and usability notes, which can inform product development and prioritize improvements.

By documenting user feedback, you can ensure that development is aligned with real user needs and continuously iterate on features based on actual usage and suggestions.

Files Overview
1. feature-requests.md
Purpose: Contains a list of feature requests made by users. This document helps the product team prioritize new features based on user demand.

How to Use: Review this file to understand what features users are asking for. Use this information when planning new releases, ensuring that user needs are a top priority. Each feature request should be tracked, and if a feature is picked up for development, the status should be updated accordingly.
2. pain-points.md

Purpose: Documents issues or frustrations reported by users while interacting with the product. These pain points highlight areas where users may be encountering difficulties or challenges, providing valuable insight for improving the user experience.

How to Use: Refer to this file when identifying areas of the product that need improvement. This document can help guide bug fixes, UX enhancements, and general improvements by focusing on the problems that users face. Track whether the pain point has been resolved or if there’s an ongoing effort to address it.
3. usability-notes.md

Purpose: Contains observations and notes about how users are interacting with the product in real-world scenarios. This document provides qualitative insights into usability, highlighting potential friction points or user behavior that might not be captured in feature requests or pain points.

How to Use: Use this file to understand the actual usage patterns and interactions of users with the product. These notes may not always be direct feedback, but rather insights gathered through user testing, customer support interactions, or behavioral analysis. Use these notes to optimize the product’s design and functionality.
How to Use the User Feedback

Collecting Feedback:
Ensure that user feedback is regularly gathered from different sources, including surveys, customer support, user testing, and feature usage analytics. Document feedback in the appropriate file (feature-requests.md, pain-points.md, or usability-notes.md) for easy reference.

Prioritizing Features and Fixes:
Regularly review the feedback and use it to prioritize features and improvements. For example, frequently requested features may be prioritized for development, and recurring pain points may become the focus of bug fixes or UI/UX enhancements.

Tracking Progress:
As features or fixes are developed to address user feedback, update the status in each document to reflect the progress. This could include marking requests as completed, noting fixes, or updating usability notes with changes made based on feedback.

Integrating into the Development Cycle:
Make user feedback a part of the ongoing development process. During sprint planning or feature design, consult the feedback documents to ensure that user concerns are addressed and improvements align with user needs.

Additional Notes
Feedback from Multiple Channels:
It’s essential to gather feedback from multiple channels (e.g., user interviews, support tickets, surveys, etc.) to get a comprehensive view of user sentiment and needs.

Continuous Improvement:
Product development should be an iterative process based on user feedback. Keep this document updated as feedback evolves, ensuring that the product always addresses the most pressing user needs.

Collaboration:
Make sure that the product, design, and development teams regularly collaborate on user feedback. Feedback from one team (e.g., product management) should be available to others (e.g., developers, UX designers) to ensure holistic solutions.
