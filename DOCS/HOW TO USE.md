Step 1: Plan Before Coding
Define a PRD (Product Requirements Document): Use Claude/Gemini to generate a clear PRD outlining the problem, solution, and expected functionality.
Design Database Schema: Get AI to draft the database schema in Markdown (.md) format for reference.
Color Palette & UI Structure: If the feature involves UI, define a color palette and layout structure based on your Figma design system.
Save Everything in Cursor: Store all generated files in .md format inside Cursor to ensure consistency.

Step 2: Start with a Strong Foundation
Use Cursor to Generate Initial Code: If applicable, use Cursor's AI-generated UI code as a starting point.
Refine in Cursor: Bring the generated code into Cursor for further development and customization.
Leverage AI for Accuracy: Ask AI to review, optimize, and suggest improvements to reduce future rework.

Step 3: Improve AI Responses with Cursor's Prompting Tools
Use cursor.directory: Access tech-specific prompts optimized for Cursor.
Customize .cursorrules: Define rules in a .cursorrules file to align AI responses with your stack, architecture, and coding standards.

Step 4: Sync and Tag Relevant Documentation
Integrate Official Docs: Pull in documentation for key frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Supabase).
Use @LibraryName for References: Quickly reference official documentation.
Add Custom Docs with @Docs: If you're using internal APIs or custom-built libraries, add their documentation for easy access.

Step 5: Get Up-to-Date Information
Use Web Search for Accuracy: Leverage Cursor’s web search tool to pull in the latest info on APIs, best practices, and updates.

Step 6: Save Working Code for Reuse
Store Good Code in .md Files: Save snippets and solutions in Markdown for easy retrieval.
Build a Library of Code Examples: Over time, this becomes a personal reference guide to speed up development.

Step 7: Query the Entire Codebase
Use Cursor’s "Query the Codebase" Feature: Search across your entire project to find, refactor, or reference existing implementations.
