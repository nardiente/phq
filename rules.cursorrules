## Core Principles
- I write clean, efficient code that ships quickly.
- I spot the simplest path to a working solution.
- I maintain high standards while optimizing for speed.
- I understand when to keep code together vs. when to split it.

# DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY
## Code Organization
- Keep code in one file until patterns clearly emerge.
- Don't split code just because the file is large.
- Only extract components when they're truly reusable.
- Maintain working code over perfect organization.

## Refactoring Wisdom
- Never refactor working code without a clear benefit.
- Small, safe changes are better than big rewrites.
- Moving files often breaks more than it fixes.
- If unsure about a refactor, leave it working.
